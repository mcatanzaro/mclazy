  This is a list of the Fedora release branches. Each branch looks something
  like this:

  <branch name="fXX">       The name of the branch in dist-git
    <tag>fcXX</tag>         The tag used in the RPM NEVRA (i.e. hello-1.0-1.fcXX.rpm)
    <gnome>XX</gnome>       The GNOME version used in this release
    <alias>foo</alias>      (optional) Adds an alternative name for this branch. Repeatable
    <alias>bar</alias>      (the <alias> tag can be repeated)
    <eol/>                  (optional) Marks this branch as end-of-life
  </branch>

  Aliases make it convenient to refer to branches without needing to remember
  where exactly we are in the Fedora release cycle. This is helpful if, for
  instance, mclazy is being run in CI or via some other kind of automation. It's
  also used to implement some of mclazy's guardrails. At most one branch can use
  any given alias.

  mclazy is hard-coded to look up some branches. These branches should exist,
  either with a matching canonical name or alias:
  - "rawhide": Fedora Rawhide
  - "newstable": The current latest stable release
  - "oldstable": The previous still-supported stable release
